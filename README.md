# MoTrackTherapyMobilePublic
To allow others to use and build upon our hand therapy AI app, we have decided to make the code publicly available. We had to remove some files that we thought might have sensitive user information. If you are interested in running this yourself or editing it (for personal, research, or commercial use), and are having trouble, please contact us and we can work with you and make sure we didn't take out any file that you might need.


Disclaimer: Use and distribution of this technology is at your own risk. If you choose to use this for your own care, or use it to give care to tothers, please confirm any information obtained from or through this app with your physical/occupational therapist or another professional healthcare provider. If you experience any pain while using the app, please stop usage and contact your healthcare provider for further instructions. At this time, MoTrack Therapy is not intended to be a standalone medical treatment but rather a supplement to in-clinic physical/occupational therapy sessions with guidance from certified medical providers, and should be treated as such. MoTrack Therapy is not intended to be medical advice.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
As you get ready to play, follow these steps to have the best experience possible.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
1. Place your phone down on a flat surface, with the screen facing up.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
2. Make sure there are no lights directly overhead.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
This makes it difficult for the camera to focus on your hand).

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
3. Make sure your sound is on.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The different sounds will let you know when different things are happening in the games.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
4. When you’re ready, the phone will ask you to line up your hand with the example on the screen.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Make sure your hand is the correct distance from the camera by making it the matching size on the screen.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
5. When your hand is lined up correctly for long enough, the screen will flash green and progress on.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:0:55.000
6. The screen will change one more time, bringing you to the game.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000  -30
Once everything seems to be working and you’re ready to play,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000  -30
begin performing the correct exercise at your own pace in this case, open palm/closed fist.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.000  -30
You will see the balloon begin to inflate. Make sure you keep your four fingers together with your thumb out for best results.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000  -30
The objective of the game is to inflate the balloon as much as possible before it pops.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000  -30
If it pops, you will not be awarded any points.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000  -30
When you have inflated the balloon as much as you think you can, pause for a moment, and the balloon should float away.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000  -30
The bigger the balloon, the more points you will be awarded.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000  -30
Make sure you don’t pause too early, or your balloon may float away before you’re finished inflating!

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000  -30
However, make sure you still take your time and don’t strain yourself to the point of discomfort.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:33.000  -30
If you do feel extreme pain or discomfort at any point, please stop playing and contact your healthcare provider.

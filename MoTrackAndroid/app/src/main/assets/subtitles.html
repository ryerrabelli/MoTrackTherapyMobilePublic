WEBVTT - MoTrack Therapy Balloon Game Subtitles, Sept 18, 2019

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
As you get ready to play, follow these steps to have the best experience possible.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
1. Place your phone down on a flat surface, with the screen facing up.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
2. Make sure there are no lights directly overhead.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
This makes it difficult for the camera to focus on your hand.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
3. Make sure your sound is on.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The different sounds will let you know when different things are happening in the games.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000
4. When you’re ready, the phone will ask you to line up your hand with the example on the screen.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Make sure your hand is the correct distance from the camera by making it the matching size on the screen.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:55.000
5. When your hand is lined up correctly for long enough, the screen will flash green and progress on.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
6. The screen will change one more time, bringing you to the game.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.000
You can begin completing your exercises.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Once everything seems to be working and you’re ready to play,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
begin performing the correct exercise at your own pace- in this case, open palm/closed fist.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.000
You will see the balloon begin to inflate. Make sure you keep your four fingers together with your thumb out for best results.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
The objective of the game is to inflate the balloon as much as possible before it pops.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
If it pops, you will not be awarded any points.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
When you have inflated the balloon as much as you think you can, pause for a moment, and the balloon should float away.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
The bigger the balloon, the more points you will be awarded.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Make sure you don’t pause too early, or your balloon may float away before you’re finished inflating!

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
However, make sure you still take your time and don’t strain yourself to the point of discomfort.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:01:09.000
If you do feel extreme pain or discomfort at any point, please stop playing and contact your healthcare provider.

This makes it difficult for the camera to focus on your hand.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
3. Make sure your sound is on.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The different sounds will let you know when different things are happening in the games.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000
4. When you’re ready, the phone will ask you to line up your hand with the example on the screen.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:55.000
5. When your hand is lined up correctly for long enough, the screen will flash green and progress on.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Once everything seems to be working and you’re ready to play

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
begin performing the correct exercise at your own pace- in this case, radial/ulnar deviation.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Make sure you keep your four fingers together with your thumb out for best results.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Soon, you will see the arm of the catapult begin to draw back.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
The objective of the game is to draw back the arm as far as it can go before it breaks.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
If it breaks, you will not be awarded any points.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:35.000
When you have pulled back the arm as much as you think you can, remove your hand from the screen, and the catapult should fire the ball at the target.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
The farther back you pull the arm, the closer your ball will land to the target’s center.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
You will earn more points when the ball lands closer to the center.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Take your time and don’t strain yourself to the point of discomfort.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
If you do feel extreme pain or discomfort at any point, please stop playing and contact your healthcare provider.
